# Manchester-Energy-Efficiency-Insights

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data for Manchester from **2014 to 2024** to evaluate trends in **energy efficiency**, **CO₂ emissions**, and **energy costs** across different property and building types. The workflow uses **Microsoft SQL Server** for data preparation and **Power BI** for analytics and interactive visualization.

## Objectives
- Import and manage EPC data using SQL Server
- Clean and transform data using T-SQL
- Integrate SQL Server data with Power BI
- Build interactive dashboards using DAX
- Identify efficiency gaps, cost drivers, and CO₂ reduction potential

## Dataset
- **Source:** UK EPC Open Data (Local Authority – Manchester)
- **Period:** 2014–2024
- **Key Attributes:**
  - Property Type
  - Built Form
  - Current & Potential Energy Efficiency
  - CO₂ Emissions (Current & Potential)
  - Energy Consumption
  - Heating, Lighting, and Hot Water Costs

## Tools & Technologies
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server
- **Query Language:** T-SQL
- **Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI
- **Analytics:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Key Visualizations
- **CO₂ vs Efficiency Density:** Relationship between energy efficiency, emissions, and consumption
- **Cost Distribution:** Heating, lighting, and hot water cost comparison by property type
- **Efficiency Improvement Potential:** Percentage efficiency gain across property categories
- **Energy Flow Overview (Sankey):** Energy movement across property characteristics
- **Current vs Potential Comparison:** Performance gaps and achievable improvements
- **Efficiency Target Tracking:** Gauge visualization against a 20% efficiency target
- **KPI Cards:** Average energy cost saving and CO₂ reduction potential
- **Slicers:** Property type, building model, and transaction type

## Key Insights
- Higher energy efficiency directly correlates with lower CO₂ emissions
- Houses and bungalows show the highest efficiency improvement potential
- Heating is the dominant energy cost driver across all property types
- All property categories benefit from targeted energy-efficiency upgrades

## Outcome
The final dashboard provides a data-driven foundation for evaluating Manchester’s housing energy performance. It supports **policy formulation**, **investment prioritization**, and **long-term sustainability and decarbonization goals**.
